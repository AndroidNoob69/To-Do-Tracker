# To-Do-Tracker
Homemade to-do tracker. My very first project please no flamerino.


You can also use this shitty program for your own use!
Simply clone this repo and change the hardcoded values in the program mainly found in the File paths.
This IS for my own personal use so I just hardcoded the paths for lazy reasons.
Bug reports are welcome but there IS NO GUARENTEE THAT I WILL FIX IT.
I oncemore admit this is a lousy program but who cares its just to kill time, maybe some day I will make it great (again?)
